I'll help you analyze the folder structure and its contents. Let me start by listing the contents of the root directory.


Ran tool
This appears to be a Python project focused on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Hallucination and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) components. Let me examine some key files to better understand the project structure and purpose.

First, let's look at the main training file:


Read file: train.py
Let me also check the model architecture:


Read file: model.py
Let me check the modules directory to understand the components better:


Ran tool
Based on my analysis, this is a sophisticated project that implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) system for handling hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Here's a detailed breakdown of the project:

1. **Project Structure**:
   - `train.py`: Main training script
   - `model.py`: Core model architecture
   - `data.py`: Data handling and loading
   - `utils.py`: Utility functions
   - `prompt_template.py`: Templates for prompts
   - `modules/`: Contains core components
     - `retriver.py`: Retrieval component
     - `base.py`: Base model implementation
     - `evaluator.py`: Hallucination evaluation
   - `data/`: Directory for datasets
   - `scripts/`: Additional utility scripts

2. **Core Architecture (HalluRLRAG)**:
   The system consists of three main components:
   - **Retriever**: Uses BERT-based models (bert-base-uncased or distilbert-base-uncased) to find relevant contexts
   - **Base Model**: Uses a large language model (deepseek-v3-671b) for generating answers
   - **Evaluator**: Evaluates generated answers for hallucinations

3. **Training Process**:
   - Uses reinforcement learning to optimize the retrieval process
   - Implements a policy network for context selection
   - Rewards are based on hallucination detection (negative reward for hallucinations)
   - Supports n-shot learning with configurable parameters
   - Includes checkpointing and logging of training progress

4. **Key Features**:
   - Configurable hyperparameters for all components
   - Support for different base models and retrievers
   - Temperature and sampling controls for generation
   - Comprehensive logging and model checkpointing
   - Batch processing support
   - GPU acceleration support

5. **Training Configuration**:
   - Learning rate: 0.001
   - Default epochs: 20
   - Batch size: 2
   - N-shot examples: 2
   - Number of candidates: 10
   - Number of samples: 20

The project appears to be designed to improve the reliability of RAG systems by:
1. Learning to select the most relevant contexts
2. Generating answers based on selected contexts
3. Evaluating and penalizing hallucinations
4. Using reinforcement learning to optimize the entire process

This is a sophisticated approach to the hallucination problem in RAG systems, using RL to learn better retrieval strategies that minimize hallucinations in the generated responses.

Would you like me to dive deeper into any particular aspect of the project?
