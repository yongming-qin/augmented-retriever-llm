# Explaination

I'll help you analyze the contents of this folder. Let me start by listing the directory contents.


Ran tool
This appears to be a Python project focused on running and learning with GPT-3, likely involving reinforcement learning (RL) based on the folder name and file structure. Let me examine some key files to better understand the project's purpose and structure.

Let me first look at the main files:


Read file: run_gpt3.py
Let me also check the algorithm file to understand the learning approach:


Read file: algorithm.py
Based on my analysis, this is a sophisticated project focused on running and learning with GPT-3, particularly in the context of reinforcement learning. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

1. **Core Files**:
   - `run_gpt3.py`: The main execution file that handles running GPT-3 models, particularly using Azure's GPT-4 API. It includes functionality for:
     - Loading and processing data
     - Making API calls to GPT-3/4
     - Managing prompts and responses
     - Handling different types of datasets (MATH, MedQA, etc.)

   - `algorithm.py`: Implements various learning algorithms including:
     - ERM (Empirical Risk Minimization)
     - DRNN (Domain Robust Neural Network)
     - DANN (Domain Adversarial Neural Network)
     - MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancy)
     - ARM-CML (Adaptive Risk Minimization with Context Meta-Learning)
     - ARM-LL (Adaptive Risk Minimization with Learned Loss)
     - ARM-BN (Adaptive Risk Minimization with Batch Normalization)

2. **Supporting Files**:
   - `base_prompt.py`: Contains base prompt templates
   - `model.py`: Defines the model architecture
   - `utilities.py`: Contains utility functions
   - `learn_policy.py`: Implements policy learning
   - `sample.py`: Handles sampling functionality

3. **Directory Structure**:
   - `cluster_results/`: Stores clustering results
   - `scripts/`: Contains various utility scripts
   - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
   - `retriever/`: Contains retrieval mechanisms (e.g., BM25 retriever)
   - `tools/`: Additional tools and utilities

4. **Key Features**:
   - Integration with Azure's GPT-4 API
   - Support for multiple datasets (MATH, MedQA, and various other NLP tasks)
   - Implementation of various domain adaptation and robust learning algorithms
   - Clustering capabilities for data analysis
   - BM25-based retrieval system
   - Support for both training and testing phases

5. **Learning Approaches**:
   The project implements several advanced learning algorithms:
   - Domain adaptation methods (DANN, MMD)
   - Robust learning approaches (DRNN)
   - Meta-learning techniques (ARM-CML)
   - Adaptive risk minimization variants

6. **Data Handling**:
   - Supports multiple data formats and sources
   - Includes data preprocessing and augmentation capabilities
   - Handles both training and test splits
   - Supports various NLP tasks and datasets

This appears to be a research-oriented project focused on improving GPT-3's performance through various learning algorithms, particularly in the context of domain adaptation and robust learning. The codebase is well-structured and implements several state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and natural language processing.

Would you like me to dive deeper into any particular aspect of the project?

I'll help you understand how to run inference tests with this codebase. Let me first check the main execution file to understand the testing parameters and requirements.


Read file: run_gpt3.py
Based on the code analysis, I can help you run some inference tests. The code is set up to work with GPT-3/4 through Azure's API. Here's how you can run a simple test:

1. First, you'll need to set up your environment. Let me check if there's a requirements file:


Ran tool
Let me check the pyproject.toml for dependencies:


Read file: pyproject.toml
Here's how you can run a simple inference test:

1. First, you'll need to install the required dependencies. Based on the imports in the code, you'll need:
```bash
pip install torch numpy openai httpx sentence-transformers scikit-learn
```

2. You'll need to set up your Azure OpenAI API credentials. The code is already configured to use Azure's GPT-4 API, but you'll need to update the credentials in `run_gpt3.py`. Look for these variables and update them with your credentials:
```python
OPENAI_ENDPOINT = "your-endpoint"
OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_MODEL = "your-deployment-model"
OPENAI_AZURE_API_VERSION = "2023-12-01-preview"
APIM_KEY = "your-api-key"
```

3. To run a simple inference test, you can use the following command:
```bash
python run_gpt3.py \
    --data_root_test path/to/your/test/data.json \
    --engine gpt4 \
    --test_number 5 \
    --shot_number 2 \
    --prompt_format Q-A \
    --temperature 0.0 \
    --max_tokens 512
```

The key parameters for inference are:
- `--data_root_test`: Path to your test data file
- `--engine`: The model to use (gpt4, text-davinci-002, or ada)
- `--test_number`: Number of test examples to run (set to a small number like 5 for testing)
- `--shot_number`: Number of few-shot examples to include
- `--prompt_format`: Format of the prompt (Q-A is question-answer format)
- `--temperature`: Controls randomness (0.0 for deterministic outputs)
- `--max_tokens`: Maximum length of the generated response

4. The code supports several datasets out of the box:
- MATH problems
- MedQA
- Various NLP tasks (squad, tweet_eval, etc.)

For a quick test, you could use a small sample of any of these datasets. The code will automatically handle the data loading and formatting.

5. The results will be saved in the `results` directory (specified by `--output_root`) with a filename that includes your experiment label, test split, prompt format, and shot number.

Would you like me to:
1. Help you set up a specific test case with a particular dataset?
2. Show you how to modify the code for a custom test case?
3. Explain more about any of the parameters or components?

Also, I notice that the code is set up to use Azure's GPT-4 API. Do you have access to Azure's OpenAI service, or would you prefer to use a different API endpoint?
